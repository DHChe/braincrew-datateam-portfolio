# Braincrew Portfolio Delivery Workflow Status

Last updated: 2026-07-19

## Purpose

This file is the durable checkpoint for the portfolio delivery flow. Update it whenever a canonical skill phase starts, completes, becomes blocked, or changes so the current route does not depend on conversation memory.

## Locked route

```text
research and AX_portfolio context
  -> setup or verify Matt Pocock workflow skills
  -> grill-with-docs when unresolved requirements remain
  -> optional time-boxed prototype for a concrete runnable uncertainty
  -> handoff
  -> to-spec
  -> to-tickets with dependency edges
  -> fresh-context implementation per ready ticket with TDD
  -> code review per ticket
  -> full benchmark and submission verification
```

`to-spec` is the implementation-facing specification and PRD-equivalent for this project. Do not run `to-prd` in parallel unless the locked route is explicitly changed. Use `writing-plans` or `ralplan` only as a named supporting step for a concrete unresolved gap, not as a silent replacement for `to-spec` or `to-tickets`.

## Current checkpoint

- Completed phase: research, role comparison, and Data Team red-team assessment.
- Completed phase: portfolio direction and evaluation boundaries locked.
- Completed phase: `brainstorming` design loop, independent specification review, and PR #1 merge into `develop`.
- Completed phase: `setup-matt-pocock-skills`; GitHub Issues was selected, the five canonical triage labels were configured, and the single-context domain-document rules were recorded.
- Completed phase: `to-spec`; the user approved the CLI-to-gate, AX Adapter, and dashboard-export test seams, and implementation specification Issue #4 was published with the `ready-for-agent` label.
- Completed phase: `to-tickets`; the user approved 12 vertical implementation slices, GitHub Issues #6 through #17 were published as sub-issues of #4, and 22 native dependency edges were recorded.
- Completed phase: Issue #6 implementation with `test-driven-development`; ten acceptance cases cover CLI execution, deterministic rerun and replay, append-only collision handling, invalid and tampered input, complete artifact-envelope validation, dataset-digest boundaries, path traversal, and commit identity validation.
- Completed phase: Issue #6 ticket-scoped code review; both the standards and specification axes passed with zero unresolved blockers after review-driven TDD repairs.
- Completed phase: the user approved the Issue #6 Git lifecycle proposal; Lore commit `b63b2f9` was pushed to `origin/feat/issue-6-cli-immutable-gate`, and PR #20 was opened against `develop`.
- Completed phase: PR #20 passed its Python quality check and was merged into `develop` as `230f90f`; Issue #6 was closed and removed from the implementation frontier.
- Completed phase: Issue #7 implementation with `test-driven-development`; controlled HTTP tests and live synthetic smoke cover the pinned Adapter boundary without claiming quality.
- Completed phase: Issue #7 ticket-scoped code review and `verification-before-completion`; both review axes have zero unresolved blocker and every fresh local gate passed.
- Completed phase: Lore commit `3aa7264` was pushed to `origin/feat/issue-7-ax-http-contract`; draft PR #21 was opened against `develop`, its first Python quality gate passed, and its remote merge state was `CLEAN` with no review comment or change request.
- Completed phase: PR #21 passed its required Python quality check, merged into `develop` as `0d137a6`, and closed Issue #7.
- Completed phase: Issue #8 implementation with `test-driven-development`; 20 versioned parsing cases, exact metric goldens, fixture CLI/result-store execution, and fail-closed `INVALID` behavior are implemented.
- Completed phase: Issue #8 ticket-scoped `code-review`; Standards and Spec axes both passed with zero remaining finding after a bounded duplication refactor and re-review.
- Completed phase: Issue #8 `verification-before-completion`; every required local gate and the installed-console-script fixture run passed with fresh evidence.
- Completed phase: the user approved the Issue #8 Git lifecycle proposal for one Lore commit, committed-state verification, branch push, and pull-request creation; merge remains excluded.
- Active canonical phase: Issue #8 pull-request verification and review gate.
- Active artifact: [Issue #8](https://github.com/DHChe/braincrew-datateam-portfolio/issues/8), labeled `ready-for-agent`, on branch `feat/issue-8-parsing-quality`.
- Active completion condition: the pushed Issue #8 pull-request head passes required checks with no unresolved review blocker, then merge is proposed separately for explicit authorization.
- Entry condition: Issues #6 and #7 are closed through merged PRs #20 and #21, and `origin/develop` points to the Issue #7 merge commit `0d137a64b86158e33a14d435caaabf5d42ea20c1`.
- Entry condition status: satisfied on 2026-07-19; the dedicated worktree is clean and based exactly on that `origin/develop` commit.
- Next canonical phase: create the authorized Lore commit, verify its clean committed state, push `feat/issue-8-parsing-quality`, and open a `develop` pull request with `Closes #8`; then wait at the remote verification gate.
- Following phase: after review fixes and full verification, stop at the Git Lifecycle Proposal Gate before any commit, push, pull request, or merge.
- Blocker: none.

## Transition history

### 2026-07-19 — Issue #8 lifecycle proposal approved

- Authorization: the user approved one Lore commit, clean committed-state verification, push to `origin/feat/issue-8-parsing-quality`, and pull-request creation against `develop`; merge was not authorized.
- Included scope: the reviewed Issue #8 dataset, contracts, deterministic parsing evaluator, fixture CLI/result store, tests, design decision, interview defense card, and workflow evidence.
- Required pre-push evidence: the committed worktree is clean; Ruff, mypy, full pytest, diff checks, and an installed-console-script parsing run pass with the committed Evaluation Plane provenance.
- Pull-request strategy: use `Closes #8`, require the Python quality check and no unresolved review blocker, and keep squash merge as a separately proposed action.
- Known risk: live AX parsing remains unobservable, so fixture completion cannot be presented as live AX parsing quality or a release `PASS`.
- Next action: create the Lore commit and run the committed-state verification before any push.

### 2026-07-19 — Issue #8 final verification completed; lifecycle proposal gate reached

- Completed skill: `verification-before-completion`.
- Quality evidence: `uv sync --frozen --all-groups`, `uv run ruff format --check .`, `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run mypy`, `uv run pytest -q`, and `git diff --check` all exited successfully; pytest reported `43 passed`.
- CLI evidence: installed `braincrew-eval run-parsing` executed `datasets/parsing/parsing_cases_v1.json` with `tests/fixtures/parsing_observations_v1.json` and stored `parsing-run-artifact-v1` outside the repository.
- Artifact evidence: run state `COMPLETED`; 20 total and scored cases; 14 Calibration and 6 Verification cases; Verification EvidenceSpan denominator 6; five applicable table and five list cases; dataset digest `sha256:a4ce3d2381853288e92cc2fd21df5cfcd9629db39ea134d8314594e146b48127`; logical digest `sha256:3e612b659ad662ce666c74e9b9bff523b43729efbdd3bb1266302ab402a906fc`.
- Provenance evidence: dataset `braincrew-parsing-quality@1.0.0`, adapter `fixture-parsing-sut-v1`, parser `fixture-parser-v1`, evaluator `parsing-quality-v1`, and declared non-executed AX SUT commit `c318b2192006bdb36a5bd5b3a2bc403425b45701` were recorded exactly.
- Review evidence: post-refactor Standards and Spec axes both returned `PASS` with zero remaining finding.
- Scope evidence: no AX parsing implementation, retrieval/answer scoring, full benchmark, or Agent trajectory evaluation was added or claimed; live AX parse observability remains explicitly unavailable and therefore invalid for a live parsing benchmark.
- Active gate: Git Lifecycle Proposal Gate; no commit, push, pull request, or merge has been performed.
- Next action: propose one Lore commit on `feat/issue-8-parsing-quality`, push to `origin`, and open a reviewed PR targeting `develop`; wait for explicit authorization before executing.

### 2026-07-19 — Issue #8 code review completed; final verification started

- Completed skill: `code-review`.
- Review evidence: the Spec axis passed with no missing, partial, incorrect, or out-of-scope behavior; the Standards axis initially reported two LOW duplicated-code smells, then passed with zero remaining finding after common CLI validation/provenance and create-only writer helpers were extracted and re-reviewed.
- Refactor evidence: fixture and parsing acceptance tests reported `13 passed`; Ruff and mypy passed before re-review.
- Active skill: `verification-before-completion`.
- Completion condition: fresh `uv sync --frozen --all-groups`, Ruff format/lint, mypy, full pytest, `git diff --check`, and the versioned 20-case fixture CLI execution all exit successfully and the stored artifact reports `COMPLETED`, 20 scored cases, Verification denominator 6, and exact provenance.
- Next action: execute the full required gate set, inspect Git status and artifact evidence, then stop at the Git Lifecycle Proposal Gate.

### 2026-07-19 — Issue #8 implementation completed; code review started

- Completed skill: `test-driven-development`.
- Completion evidence: dataset, EvidenceSpan integrity, strict schema, exact metric golden, 20-case macro aggregation, parser-version/case-set integrity, fixture CLI artifact, append-only collision, and unobservable-parse `INVALID` tests all passed; full pytest reported `43 passed` before review.
- Active skill: `code-review` with separate Standards and Spec axes.
- Expected artifact: findings with severity and exact file references against the complete uncommitted Issue #8 worktree diff.
- Completion condition: every blocking finding is repaired through a new RED/GREEN cycle and both axes pass on re-review.
- Next action: pin `origin/develop@0d137a64b86158e33a14d435caaabf5d42ea20c1`, enumerate tracked and untracked worktree changes, and run the two review axes without committing.

### 2026-07-19 — Issue #8 implementation started

- Active skill: `test-driven-development`.
- Expected artifact: a versioned 20-case parsing dataset with a frozen 14 Calibration / 6 Verification split, fixture parsing observations, deterministic EvidenceSpan/structure/metadata/table/list metrics, hand-calculated goldens, and an append-only CLI result artifact.
- Completion condition: each new behavior is observed failing before implementation, all 20 cases execute through the CLI and result store, unavailable parsing produces `INVALID` rather than `PASS`, exact dataset/evaluator/adapter/SUT identities are recorded, and Ruff, mypy, full pytest, and diff checks pass.
- Entry evidence: `origin/develop`, branch HEAD, and merge base all equal `0d137a64b86158e33a14d435caaabf5d42ea20c1`; Issues #6 and #7 are closed through merged PRs #20 and #21 with successful required checks; Issue #8 has `ready-for-agent`.
- Clean baseline: `uv sync --frozen --all-groups`, Ruff format and lint, mypy, full pytest (`25 passed`), and `git diff --check` succeeded before the first RED.
- Scope exclusions: AX parsing implementation changes, retrieval or answer scoring, the complete 100-case/live benchmark, and Agent trajectory evaluation.
- Next action: add and run the first failing parsing dataset-contract and hand-calculated metric tests before production implementation.

### 2026-07-19 — Issue #6 implementation started

- Active skill: `test-driven-development`.
- Expected artifact: one versioned fixture case that runs from the Typer CLI through a fixture SUT adapter and deterministic evaluator into an append-only JSON result with a gate decision, plus deterministic artifact replay.
- Completion condition: the acceptance test is observed failing before implementation, then passes with Ruff, mypy, full pytest, and repeated-run logical digest equality evidence.
- Entry evidence: `feat/issue-6-cli-immutable-gate` and fetched `origin/develop` both point to `ffb56a86ca6a83b4c081cfd5571e4bc4aaf2d06d`; Issue #6 is open, labeled `ready-for-agent`, and has no blocker.
- Scope exclusions: live AX HTTP, the full metric suite, the 100-case dataset, dashboard work, and Agent trajectory evaluation.
- Next action: write and run the failing Issue #6 CLI acceptance test before production implementation.

### 2026-07-19 — Issue #6 implementation completed; code review started

- Completed skill: `test-driven-development`.
- Completion evidence: `uv run ruff format --check .`, `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run mypy`, `uv run pytest -q`, and `git diff --check` passed; two console-script fixture runs and artifact replay produced the same logical digest `sha256:d11ba8fc170c5b2be94688d73b4db707aeeefe00bcdea0a73854a0555b83759e` and `PASS` decision.
- Active skill: `code-review`.
- Expected artifact: ticket-scoped review findings with severity and exact file references.
- Completion condition: all blocking findings are fixed through TDD and fresh verification passes.
- Next action: review the full Issue #6 diff before proposing commit, push, pull request, or merge actions.

### 2026-07-19 — Issue #6 code review requested fixes

- Standards axis: four findings; worst findings were the advanced `origin/develop` base and non-UTF-8 fixture traceback instead of an explicit invalid-input failure.
- Spec axis: four findings; worst finding was accepting a caller-supplied Evaluation Plane SHA as executed provenance without recording dirty state.
- Shared findings: dataset digest incorrectly covered fixture response and prompt/model configuration; replay did not require the complete `run-artifact-v1` envelope; runner, evaluator, adapter, and store responsibilities were mixed.
- Scope review: no live AX, full metric suite, 100-case dataset, dashboard, or Agent trajectory scope creep found.
- Active skill: `test-driven-development` for review-driven repairs.
- Completion condition: each behavior defect is observed RED before its fix, module boundaries are repaired without behavior change, the branch is moved onto current `origin/develop`, and fresh review plus verification passes.

### 2026-07-19 — Issue #6 code review and verification completed

- Completed skills: `test-driven-development`, `code-review`, and `verification-before-completion`.
- Review evidence: the independent standards and specification review axes both returned `PASS` with zero blockers after confirming the provenance, invalid-input, full artifact-envelope, dataset-digest, module-boundary, and latest-`develop` repairs.
- Branch evidence: `feat/issue-6-cli-immutable-gate`, fetched `origin/develop`, and their merge base all point to `2c3540ed37afeb865bde1466ef992af278799700`; the ancestor check returned zero.
- Verification evidence: `uv lock --check`, `uv sync --frozen --all-groups`, `uv run ruff format --check .`, `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run mypy`, `uv run pytest -q`, and `git diff --check` passed; pytest reported ten passing acceptance tests.
- Replay evidence: two console-script fixture runs and artifact replay returned `PASS` with the same logical digest `sha256:ed3a600bf7bcf75d8c5664a71fec6efbaeac78e8e59d9cdacdd04870ff140155`.
- Scope evidence: no live AX HTTP connection, full metric suite, 100-case dataset, dashboard, or Agent trajectory evaluation was added or claimed.
- Active gate: Git Lifecycle Proposal Gate; no commit, push, pull request, or merge has been performed.
- Next action: present the verified ticket-scoped lifecycle proposal and wait for explicit authorization before executing its first write action.

### 2026-07-19 — Issue #6 lifecycle proposal approved; PR opened

- Authorization: the user approved the proposed commit, push, and pull-request sequence; merge remains a separate evidence-gated action.
- Commit evidence: Lore commit `b63b2f926e17c549afbfc9037eb3e8e2f92a5df4` contains the reviewed Issue #6 implementation and documentation.
- Remote evidence: `origin/feat/issue-6-cli-immutable-gate` was created and [PR #20](https://github.com/DHChe/braincrew-datateam-portfolio/pull/20) targets `develop` with `Closes #6`.
- Pre-push verification: the committed branch remained based on `origin/develop` at `2c3540ed37afeb865bde1466ef992af278799700`; Ruff, mypy, ten pytest cases, and diff checks passed.
- Replay evidence: two clean committed-state CLI runs and replay returned `PASS` with logical digest `sha256:b033d931313f3ae2462ed0068712f900b7cf9f8b8dd1433c961fdc10c6e063dc`.
- Active gate: wait for the latest PR checks and review evidence, then request explicit merge authorization.

### 2026-07-19 — Issue #6 merged; Issue #7 implementation started

- Merge evidence: PR #20 reports `MERGED` with successful `Python quality gates`; fetched `origin/develop` points to merge commit `230f90fb53df950173896bd6824792e3a70945ae`, and Issue #6 is closed.
- Frontier evidence: Issue #7 has only Issue #6 as a native blocker; #6 is closed. Issue #7 now carries `ready-for-agent`, while the label was removed from completed Issue #6.
- Active skill: `test-driven-development`.
- Expected artifact: a versioned `ax-sut-http-v1` Adapter contract and capability manifest that preserve the pinned AX identity, operation availability, every HTTP attempt, response provenance, timing, and permanent or retryable failure classification without importing AX internals.
- Completion condition: controlled HTTP tests cover success, timeout, `429`, `5xx`, schema mismatch, and permanent failure; preflight makes missing parsing observations explicit; any available live smoke uses synthetic or publicly releasable input; all repository quality gates and ticket-scoped review pass.
- Branch evidence: local `develop`, `origin/develop`, and `feat/issue-7-ax-http-contract` started at `230f90fb53df950173896bd6824792e3a70945ae`; `uv sync --frozen --all-groups`, Ruff format and lint, mypy, the full ten-test suite, and the Issue #6 acceptance gate passed before Issue #7 edits.
- Scope exclusions: AX product implementation, the full parsing/retrieval/answer metric suites, the 100-case dataset, dashboard work, and Agent trajectory evaluation.
- Next action: add and run the first failing controlled HTTP contract test before implementing the live Adapter.

### 2026-07-19 — Issue #7 implementation completed; code review started

- Completed skill: `test-driven-development`.
- Controlled evidence: fifteen Issue #7 contract tests cover capability preflight, frozen field mappings and schema digests, create-only manifest persistence, retrieve, answer, source text, explicit parse unavailability, timeout, `429`, `5xx`, permanent `401`, response schema mismatch, invalid tenant configuration, and bearer-credential exclusion.
- Live evidence: the pinned AX stack reported ready; preflight confirmed four supported operations and explicit parse/corpus-identity gaps. A synthetic retrieval returned zero candidates, and answer generation failed closed as `insufficient_evidence` with zero citations and no generated natural-language answer.
- Verification evidence: `uv lock --check`, frozen sync, Ruff formatting and lint, mypy, all 23 tests, the ten-case Issue #6 acceptance gate, wheel build, packaged `ax-http-v1.yaml`, and `git diff --check` passed after implementation repairs.
- Active skill: `code-review`.
- Expected artifact: separate repository-standards and Issue #7 specification findings with exact file references and no unresolved blocker.
- Completion condition: blocking findings are repaired through TDD and the full verification sequence passes again.
- Next action: review the full worktree diff from `origin/develop@230f90fb53df950173896bd6824792e3a70945ae`.

### 2026-07-19 — Issue #7 code review requested fixes; verification started

- Review findings: repository-standards review found that `bearer_token` could enter a serialized configuration; specification review found that failure/preflight evidence lacked the canonical request identity and that `ax-http-v1.yaml` lacked exact field mappings plus literal response-schema digests.
- Repair evidence: each behavior was first captured by a failing test. `bearer_token` is now excluded from representation and serialization; all HTTP requests send evaluation run, case, and correlation headers; success, failure, and preflight evidence preserve the same canonical request; the packaged contract locks field mappings and validates literal digests against the complete Pydantic response schemas.
- Review result: separate repository-standards and Issue #7 specification passes report zero unresolved blocker. No AX internal import, copied implementation, expanded benchmark scope, or quality claim was found.
- Active skill: `verification-before-completion`.
- Completion condition: the full repository gates, wheel-content check, latest pinned live synthetic smoke, and diff hygiene all pass after the review-driven repairs.

### 2026-07-19 — Issue #7 code review and verification completed

- Completed skills: `test-driven-development`, `code-review`, and `verification-before-completion`.
- Review evidence: repository-standards and Issue #7 specification reviews both returned `PASS` with zero unresolved blocker after the credential, canonical-request, field-mapping, and schema-digest repairs.
- Fresh repository evidence: frozen sync, Ruff format and lint, mypy, all 25 tests, the ten-case Issue #6 acceptance gate, wheel build, packaged Adapter code and `ax-http-v1.yaml`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Fresh live evidence: the post-review run `issue-7-live-review` against AX commit `c318b2192006bdb36a5bd5b3a2bc403425b45701` reported ready; preserved preflight, retrieval, and answer case identities; confirmed four available operations plus the explicit parse and corpus-identity gaps; and repeated the zero-candidate, `insufficient_evidence`, zero-citation, no-generated-answer result without making a quality claim.
- Environment cleanup: the temporary alternate-port AX Compose containers and network were removed after the smoke; named data volumes were preserved.
- Active gate: Git Lifecycle Proposal Gate. No commit, push, pull request, or merge has been performed for Issue #7.

### 2026-07-19 — Issue #7 Git publication authorized

- Authorization: the user approved the proposed single Lore commit, push to `origin/feat/issue-7-ax-http-contract`, and draft pull request to `develop`; merge remains explicitly excluded.
- Included scope: the reviewed AX HTTP Adapter, packaged contract and dependency lock, controlled tests, live-smoke evidence, locked design decision, interview defense, and delivery-workflow state.
- Publication completion condition: the remote branch and draft pull request point to the verified Lore commit, after which required checks and review evidence become the active gate.

### 2026-07-19 — Issue #7 draft pull request passed its first remote gate

- Publication evidence: Lore commit `3aa72646c134c13ad261542fd25f9a3c79879cd3` is the head of `origin/feat/issue-7-ax-http-contract`, and draft PR #21 targets `develop` at `230f90fb53df950173896bd6824792e3a70945ae`.
- Remote evidence: `Python quality gates` completed successfully; GitHub reported `CLEAN`, with zero PR review, issue comment, inline comment, or requested change.
- Authorization: the user instructed the next step after publication, authorizing the ready-for-review transition but not merge.
- Active gate: publish this status update, require the new head's Python gate to pass, then mark PR #21 ready for review and stop before merge.

### 2026-07-19 — Issue #7 squash merge authorized

- Ready evidence: PR #21 is not a draft, its latest Python quality gate passed, GitHub reports `CLEAN`, and no review comment, requested change, or unresolved blocker exists.
- Authorization: the user approved the proposed squash merge into `develop` and removal of the remote `feat/issue-7-ax-http-contract` branch.
- Exclusion: local worktree cleanup and any Issue #8 implementation remain outside this merge transaction.
- Completion condition: verify the merged PR state, returned squash commit ancestry in fetched `origin/develop`, automatic Issue #7 closure, and remote branch deletion before reporting completion.

## Transition record format

For each transition, record:

- date and phase;
- active skill or workflow;
- expected artifact and completion condition;
- completion evidence or blocker;
- exact next skill or action and its entry condition.

Do not mark a phase complete merely because a document exists. Record the review, test, benchmark, or merge evidence required by that phase.
