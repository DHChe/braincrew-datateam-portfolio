# Braincrew Portfolio Delivery Workflow Status

Last updated: 2026-07-19

## Purpose

This file is the durable checkpoint for the portfolio delivery flow. Update it whenever a canonical skill phase starts, completes, becomes blocked, or changes so the current route does not depend on conversation memory.

## Locked route

```text
research and AX_portfolio context
  -> setup or verify Matt Pocock workflow skills
  -> grill-with-docs when unresolved requirements remain
  -> optional time-boxed prototype for a concrete runnable uncertainty
  -> handoff
  -> to-spec
  -> to-tickets with dependency edges
  -> fresh-context implementation per ready ticket with TDD
  -> code review per ticket
  -> full benchmark and submission verification
```

`to-spec` is the implementation-facing specification and PRD-equivalent for this project. Do not run `to-prd` in parallel unless the locked route is explicitly changed. Use `writing-plans` or `ralplan` only as a named supporting step for a concrete unresolved gap, not as a silent replacement for `to-spec` or `to-tickets`.

## Current checkpoint

- Completed phase: research, role comparison, and Data Team red-team assessment.
- Completed phase: portfolio direction and evaluation boundaries locked.
- Completed phase: `brainstorming` design loop, independent specification review, and PR #1 merge into `develop`.
- Completed phase: `setup-matt-pocock-skills`; GitHub Issues was selected, the five canonical triage labels were configured, and the single-context domain-document rules were recorded.
- Completed phase: `to-spec`; the user approved the CLI-to-gate, AX Adapter, and dashboard-export test seams, and implementation specification Issue #4 was published with the `ready-for-agent` label.
- Completed phase: `to-tickets`; the user approved 12 vertical implementation slices, GitHub Issues #6 through #17 were published as sub-issues of #4, and 22 native dependency edges were recorded.
- Active canonical phase: none.
- Next canonical phase: fresh-context implementation of Issue #6 with TDD, followed by ticket-scoped code review.
- Entry condition: Issue #6 is the only unblocked implementation ticket and carries `ready-for-agent`; Issues #7 through #17 remain blocked by their recorded dependency edges.
- Entry condition status: satisfied on 2026-07-19; implementation must start from the latest verified `develop` on a ticket-bounded feature branch.
- Following phase: after Issue #6 passes its implementation and review gates, remove its frontier role and activate the next dependency-unblocked ticket.
- Blocker: none.

## Transition record format

For each transition, record:

- date and phase;
- active skill or workflow;
- expected artifact and completion condition;
- completion evidence or blocker;
- exact next skill or action and its entry condition.

Do not mark a phase complete merely because a document exists. Record the review, test, benchmark, or merge evidence required by that phase.
