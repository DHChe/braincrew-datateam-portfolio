# Braincrew Portfolio Delivery Workflow Status

Last updated: 2026-07-19

## Purpose

This file is the durable checkpoint for the portfolio delivery flow. Update it whenever a canonical skill phase starts, completes, becomes blocked, or changes so the current route does not depend on conversation memory.

## Locked route

```text
research and AX_portfolio context
  -> setup or verify Matt Pocock workflow skills
  -> grill-with-docs when unresolved requirements remain
  -> optional time-boxed prototype for a concrete runnable uncertainty
  -> handoff
  -> to-spec
  -> to-tickets with dependency edges
  -> fresh-context implementation per ready ticket with TDD
  -> code review per ticket
  -> full benchmark and submission verification
```

`to-spec` is the implementation-facing specification and PRD-equivalent for this project. Do not run `to-prd` in parallel unless the locked route is explicitly changed. Use `writing-plans` or `ralplan` only as a named supporting step for a concrete unresolved gap, not as a silent replacement for `to-spec` or `to-tickets`.

## Current checkpoint

- Completed phase: research, role comparison, and Data Team red-team assessment.
- Completed phase: portfolio direction and evaluation boundaries locked.
- Completed phase: `brainstorming` design loop, independent specification review, and PR #1 merge into `develop`.
- Active canonical phase: none.
- Next canonical phase: `setup-matt-pocock-skills` verification and repository configuration.
- Entry condition: local `develop` matches the merged remote `origin/develop`, and the Matt Pocock issue-tracker and domain-document configuration is inspected.
- Entry condition status: Git synchronization is satisfied as of 2026-07-19; local `develop` and `origin/develop` both point to merge commit `18a768ab5299959ccc9257a766295768cf87b3ad`. Matt Pocock repository configuration inspection remains for the next phase.
- Following phase: `to-spec`, using the merged design, review history, and interview defense dossier as its sources.
- Blocker: none.

## Transition record format

For each transition, record:

- date and phase;
- active skill or workflow;
- expected artifact and completion condition;
- completion evidence or blocker;
- exact next skill or action and its entry condition.

Do not mark a phase complete merely because a document exists. Record the review, test, benchmark, or merge evidence required by that phase.
